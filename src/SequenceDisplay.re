 * TODO: replace `setinterval` with a `requestAnimationFrame`
 * based solution. Slight wierdness - Bs_WebIncubator has a
 * binding for `requestAnimationFrame`, but not for
 * `cancelAnimationFrame`.
 * REVIEW: The state _could_ be dispensed with entirely, need to
 * investigate. Because CSS props can be passed, a keyframe
 * animation could be generated within the component based on
 * passed args: the sequence is simple, and the timings linear.
 * The end event could occur on an `onAnimationEnd` or
 * `onTransitionEnd` callback. This idea has legs. Needs a
